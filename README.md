# Self-sampling system

This is a placeholder repository for the self-sampling project.

## Description

The Self-Sample HPV Typing System is a user-interfacing application designed to facilitate seamless communication between users and the reference laboratory regarding self-taken samples for HPV typing.

The system aims to empower individuals by enabling them to collect their own samples conveniently, without the need for a healthcare professional. Users can easily obtain a sample at home using provided kits and submit it for HPV typing analysis. The application acts as a bridge, ensuring secure and efficient communication between the users and the reference laboratory, providing them with essential information, results, and updates throughout the process.

Key Features:

    User Interface: The system provides a user-friendly interface that guides users through the process of self-sampling, ensuring accurate collection and preservation of samples.

    Sample Tracking: Each sample is uniquely linked to the user's identity through a secure identification system. This allows for reliable tracking of samples and ensures that results are attributed to the correct individuals.

    Secure Data Transmission: The system employs robust encryption protocols to safeguard sensitive user information and maintain confidentiality during the transmission of sample data and results.

    Real-time Updates: Users are provided with real-time updates on the status of their sample.

    Result Delivery: Once the HPV typing analysis is completed, the system securely delivers the results to the users. The results are presented in a clear and easily understandable format, accompanied by relevant explanations and recommendations, if necessary.

By leveraging this system, individuals can conveniently and confidently participate in HPV typing, contributing to their own healthcare and well-being. The self-sample HPV typing system enhances accessibility, privacy, and efficiency, ultimately promoting early detection and proactive management of HPV-related risks.
